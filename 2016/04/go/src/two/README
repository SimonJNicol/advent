don't forget to export the GOPATH to the go above the src
$ cd ../..
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`
that way, the following will work
$ go build
$ ./two     <--- enormous static executable
and maybe even
$ go install
rather than simply
$ go run two.go
and, I'm breaking the rules by symlinking the puzzle input file
