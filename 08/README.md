Structure packing got me on the first task!
I had to pack every 1 bytes in order to get it to run error free.
Valgrind is happy now.

```
==5315== 
==5315== HEAP SUMMARY:
==5315==     in use at exit: 0 bytes in 0 blocks
==5315==   total heap usage: 1,858 allocs, 1,858 frees, 78,979 bytes allocated
==5315== 
==5315== All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible

==5315== ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
